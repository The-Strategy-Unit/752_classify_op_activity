# Classifying Outpatient Activity by Function
This repository contains the R code and reference tables used in the Midlands Decision Support Network (MDSN) project, "Classifying Outpatient Activity by Function".
"Master.R" contains instructions and executes other necessary scripts. 

Given the relative simplicity of the algorithm, we suggest it could - with moderate effort - be re-written in SQL or in Python. See <https://www.midlandsdecisionsupport.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/dsu_classify_op_appendix_v0.1.pdf> for methods. Note that basic SQL translation is provided for the queries of SUS tables at the end of the query.R scripts.
